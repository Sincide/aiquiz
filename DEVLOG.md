## 2024-12-19 - Launch Script Cleanup
- **Removed unused launch scripts**: Deleted launch-quiz-silent.fish, launch-quiz-desktop.fish, launch-quiz-wrapper.sh, cissp-quiz, and cissp-quiz-debug
- **Kept launch-quiz.fish**: The preferred script for terminal usage that starts Flask in background and opens Brave browser
- **Reason**: Fuzzel integration attempts failed, user prefers terminal launch, no need for multiple similar scripts
- **Usage**: `./launch-quiz.fish` from terminal

## 2024-12-19 - Continue Quiz Feature
- **Added continue quiz functionality**: Users can now resume interrupted quiz sessions instead of always starting fresh
- **Home page detection**: Checks for active quiz session (`quiz_question_ids` in session) and shows continue option if available
- **Progress display**: Shows current question number, total questions, mode (normal/favorites), randomization status, and progress percentage
- **Continue vs Start Fresh**: Two buttons - "Continue Quiz" goes directly to `/quiz`, "Start Fresh Quiz" clears session and reloads page
- **Session management**: Added `/api/clear_session` endpoint to properly reset quiz state
- **Visual enhancement**: Special styling for continue quiz card with gradient background and progress bar
- **User flow**: Solves the issue where users lost progress when accidentally going back to home page

## 2024-12-19 - Navigation & Answer Persistence Fixes
- **Fixed "Next Question" button logic**: No longer incorrectly assumes wrong answer when navigating without submitting
- **Added answer persistence**: Session now tracks `answered_questions` with user answers, correctness, and timestamps
- **Prevents re-asking answered questions**: When navigating back/forth, previously answered questions show their results immediately
- **New `/api/next_question` endpoint**: Separate from submit logic, properly advances question index without recording an answer
- **Enhanced question display**: Shows previous answers and results when revisiting answered questions
- **Pre-selection of previous answers**: MCQ radio buttons and ordering lists restore previous answers on revisit
- **Improved UX flow**: Users can now freely navigate through quiz without losing answers or accidentally triggering wrong submissions
- **AI explanation continuity**: AI explanations work correctly for previously answered questions using stored answer data

## 2024-12-19 - Button Behavior Debugging
- **Issue reported**: Two "Next Question" buttons (submit button changed to "Next Question →" and "Continue" in result card) behaving differently
- **Debugging approach**: Added console logging to trace which functions are called by each button
- **Button separation**: Created distinct functions - `handleSubmitButton()`, `continueToNext()`, and `navigateWithoutSubmit()`
- **Expected behavior**: Both buttons should call `navigateWithoutSubmit()` when question is already answered
- **Investigation needed**: Check browser console logs to verify actual button behavior vs expected behavior

## 2024-12-19 - Single Button Simplification
- **Removed confusing dual buttons**: Eliminated the "Continue" button from result card completely
- **Single button logic**: Only one Submit/Next Question button now handles all interactions
- **Button states**: "Submit Answer" → "Next Question →" → "Complete Quiz"
- **Simplified event handling**: Single `handleSubmitButton()` function handles all button states
- **Clear state transitions**: Submit answer → change to Next Question → navigate → change to Submit Answer (next question)
- **End-of-quiz handling**: Button shows "Complete Quiz" on final question and triggers completion modal
- **Removed redundant functions**: Eliminated `continueToNext()` and `nextQuestion()` legacy functions

## 2024-12-19 - Duplicate Event Listeners Bug Fix
- **Found root cause**: Previous button was incorrectly triggering submissions because of duplicate event listeners
- **Problem**: Two event listeners on submit button - `handleSubmitButton()` (correct) and `submitAnswer()` (legacy, wrong)
- **Legacy listener issue**: Old `submitAnswer()` function was auto-submitting answers on every button click
- **Fix**: Removed duplicate event listener setup, now only uses `setupEventListeners()` function
- **Result**: Previous button now works correctly without unwanted answer submissions
- **Added debugging**: Console logging to track button clicks and navigation behavior

## 2024-12-19 - Randomization Navigation Investigation
- **Issue reported**: With randomization active, "Previous" button seems to show different questions instead of preserving sequence
- **Expected behavior**: Previous button should navigate to actual previous question in the randomized sequence
- **Current implementation**: Quiz start shuffles questions once, stores fixed `quiz_question_ids` array, navigation uses index
- **Theory**: Should work correctly - randomization happens once at start, navigation preserves shuffled order
- **Debugging approach**: Added server-side logging to track question ID sequences and index changes
- **Investigation**: Need to verify if randomized sequence is actually preserved or if there's hidden re-shuffling

## Navigation Bug Fix

### Previous Button Issue Resolved
- **Issue**: Previous button was appearing to go forward instead of backward in quiz navigation
- **Root Cause**: Navigation logic was correct, but the user flow was confusing due to answer submission not auto-advancing
- **Solution**: Restored automatic advancement to next question after submitting an answer in `submit_answer` endpoint
- **Technical Details**: The `session['current_index']` is now properly incremented after answer submission, making Previous/Next navigation work as expected
- **User Experience**: Quiz flow now works intuitively - submit answer advances to next question, Previous button goes back to previous question
- **Status**: Fixed and tested - navigation now works correctly in both directions
