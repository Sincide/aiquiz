- **Question Review Mode**: Browse past results and favorites with filtering.
- **Statistics Summary**: Display overall accuracy and per-domain performance charts.
- **Import Tool**: Support importing new JSON question files via a simple dialog.
- **Config Editor**: GUI for editing configuration options such as data directory and preferred Ollama model.
- **Packaging**: Provide an install script and desktop launcher for easier use.
